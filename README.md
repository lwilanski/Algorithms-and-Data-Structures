# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Course Description

This repository contains materials and projects from the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course conducted in Python at AGH University of Science and Technology. The course was divided into three main sections:

- **Sorting Algorithms** - various methods for sorting data.
- **Graph Algorithms** - algorithms for searching and analyzing graphs.
- **Dynamic Programming** - techniques for optimizing decision-making problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three directories corresponding to the course sections. It includes original implementations of algorithms and data structures required to be implemented in the course without the use of external libraries and built-in Python functions.

The repository also includes homework assignments, quizzes, and examination materials.
